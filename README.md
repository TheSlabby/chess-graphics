# Chess Graphics

Chessboard and pieces, using [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) library.
\
In the future, I plan to add Stockfish for game analysis and custom Lua-based extensions.



## Build with Clang
`clang++ -o chess_graphics main.cpp Chessboard.cpp -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system && ./chess_graphics`
